/**

 This behavior used by elements that need to render multiple models backed
 by 'list' array. You may want to use ModelView to render individual
 models in the list. The behavior supports element selection by setting predefined
 $selected property on list elements.

 ### Example:

 #### HTML:

     <ul>
       <template id="list-template" is="dom-repeat" items="[[list]]">
         <li id="[[item.id]]">
           <paper-checkbox checked="{{item.$selected}}">
           <model-view state-path="[[statePath]].list.#[[index]]"></model-view>
         </li>
       </template>
     </ul>
     Selected: [[selectedCount]] items
     <paper-button on-tap="onDeleteTap">Delete</paper-button>

 #### JavaScript:

     Polymer({

       is: "list-element",

       behaviors: [
         UniFlow.ListView,
         UniFlow.StateAware
       ],

       onDeleteTap() {
         this.deleteSelected();
       }

     });

 In the example above list view element is also state-aware, meaning it has its own place
 in the application state tree. Assuming it has been declared as follows:

     <list-element state-path="state.listElement"></list-element>

 it will be rendering `state.listElement.list` and observing changes to it. Each `model-view`
 within dom-repeat template will have `state-path` property  set to
 `state.listElement.list.#<index>`  where `index` is the element's index in the array.
