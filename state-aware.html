  /**
   Key mixin that must be assigned to all elements that need to access
   application state and/or have access to the application element. The element is
   notified of any changes to application's state, as well as all its properties
   when they're modified by state mutator elements. `state-path` property must
   be used to identify path to element's state in application state tree. 

   ### Example:

   #### HTML:

      <template>

        <div>Value A: [[state.valueA]]</div>
        <div>Value B: [[valueB]]</div>

      </template>

   #### JavaScript:

      class MyElement extends UniFlow.StateAware(Polymer.Element) {
        static get is() { return 'my-element'; }

        static get properties() {
          return {
            valueB: String
          }
        }
      }

      customElement.define(MyElement.is, MyElement);

   When above element is declared as follows:

      <my-element state-path="state.myElement"></my-element>

   it will be notified about changes (and render those) to `state.valueA` or
   `state.myElement.valueB` in action dispatchers or other state mutating
   elements.
