  /**

   Apply this mixin to your main application element. It provides global
   state and functionality to maintain individual elements states. This mixin
   is responsible for notifying all state-aware elements about their state
   changes (provided those elements have `statePath` property defined).
   Only one element in the application is supposed to have this mixin.

   ### Example:

   #### HTML:

       <template>

         <!-- action dispatchers in the order of action processing -->
         <action-dispatcher-a state="{{state}}"></action-dispatcher-a>
         <action-dispatcher-b state="{{state}}"></action-dispatcher-b>

         <!-- state-aware elements -->
         <some-element state-path="state.someElement"></some-element>

       </template>

   #### JavaScript:
       class MyApp extends UniFlow.ApplicationState(Polymer.Element) {
         static get is() { return 'my-app'; }

         connectedCallback() {
           super.ConnectedCallback();

           this.state = {
             someElement: {}
           }
         }
       }

       customElements.define(MyApp.is,MyApp);

   In the example above, `<some-element>` will receive notification of any changes to the state,
   as if it was declared as follows:

       <some-element state="[[state]]"></some-element>

   Also, if `<some-element>` has `propertyA`, on element attach this property will be assigned
   the value of `state.someElement.propertyA`, and receive all notification of the property change
   whenever the corresponding data in state tree changes. This essentially translates to following
   declaration:

       <some-element state="[[state]]"
                     propertyA="[[state.someElement.propertyA]]">
       </some-element>

   Note that data binding is one-way in both cases. Although state-aware elements can modify their
   own state, it is considered their private state and no other elements will be notified of those
   changes.
